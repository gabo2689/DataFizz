Domains beyond Amazon.com
- I will create "x" services to detect which page is requested(amazon, ebay, etc). Depending on the result,
I would call the correct service that contains specific DOM parsing logic to web scrap it.
For the service we can use Scala, C# or other language.
For the scraping we can use the cheerio library.


Products beyond just simply books.
- if you need to detect information about product beyond the books, you need to know how is the structure for the DOM.
for example if you need to get the price for the other products different to books and you can
find in the similar part in the DOM, you can create a function where receives parameter this part of the DOM
and return the information you need.
for example if you search the price for book and the price you can find in
<span id="priceblock_ourprice" class="a-size-medium a-color-price">$19.99</span>,
you can find the price for other product in the same part of the DOM.


Parse and ship 2,000,000 books (in a reasonably time frame; e.g., polynomial time) instead of merely 20.

1.- For this part you can get the information about the books

2.- save the information about the books in memory.

3.- we need to sort the information for the books,
for this part we can load this information in memory and sort for pounds in this case we can use QuickSort,
we used memory because is more faster and we don't have call to read in hdd when loading the file.

4.- Create a function where receive parameters the sorted books,
in this part we can create boxes and put inside this boxes the books,
we can set a limit for box for pound and if the pound the boxes is more the
limit we create a new box for the next books, the all in loop to checked the pound for each book.

All with the idea to send the all books inside boxes because is more to easy to load.
